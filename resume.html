	<h1>Resume</h1>

			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<hr>
				<p>I have applied my undergraduate Political Science degree and Paralegal Certification to roles requiring communication with diverse audiences. Authoring documents in the legal field required organization and communication across discrete and diverse resources. This included clients, attorneys, opposing counsels, court administrators, judges, nonprofits, companies, and various government officers. This required me to set a scope and tone for communications ensuring that client confidentiality was secure, and objectives were met. I have previous document management experience from working in a regulated production environment for medical and safety products during college. Within that environment, I was trained in, and applied, Good Documentation Practices, and continued to use these skills to great effect later in my career. I am currently working as a deli supervisor for Kowalski’s Markets. My combined experience makes me an excellent candidate for a variety of customer service and compliance roles.</p>
			<h2>Skills Set</h2>
		<hr>
		<ul>
				<li>Document Drafting/Editing – My undergraduate education in Political Science was writing intensive and utilized the Chicago Manual of Style. The certificate education I received taught me how to write legalistically, emphasizing how to articulate relevant facts in a concise manner.</li>

				<li>Client contact – As a paralegal, I served as a liaison between clients and attorneys. This involved explaining legal interpretations to clients as per attorney instructions, and articulating client concerns to attorneys.</li>

My additional certificate education trained me to analyze and comprehend precedent. These skillsets can be applied in a variety of settings where quick identification of the criteria for which specific facts are relevant is required.</li>

				<li>Communication – Obtaining compiling and summarizing input from subject matter experts and communicating to clients in an understandable manner.<li>
